🛒 Customer Purchase Prediction
📌 Overview
This project predicts whether a customer will make a purchase using a Random Forest Classifier. Since datasets often have an imbalance between buyers and non-buyers, SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) is used to balance the data for better accuracy.

This project demonstrates data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization, making it a strong addition to an MSc portfolio.

🎯 Key Features
✅ Data Preprocessing – Scaling and preparing features
✅ Handling Imbalanced Data – Using SMOTE to improve model performance
✅ Random Forest Model – A powerful ensemble learning technique
✅ Model Evaluation – Accuracy, classification report, confusion matrix
✅ Visualization – Confusion matrix heatmap for better insights

🛠️ Technologies Used
🔹 Python – Programming language
🔹 Pandas & NumPy – Data handling
🔹 Scikit-Learn – Machine learning
🔹 Imbalanced-Learn (SMOTE) – Fixing class imbalance
🔹 Matplotlib & Seaborn – Data visualization
📊 Model Performance
The model is evaluated using:
📌 Accuracy: ✅ 45% 
📌 Classification Report: Precision, Recall, F1-score
📌 Confusion Matrix: Visual representation of correct/incorrect predictions
